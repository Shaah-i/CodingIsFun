# CodingIsFun
Codes written for fun and experiments

I try to spend my time tinkering with python and learning new stuff on the way.
This repo will have all sort of fun codes like Rock-Paper-Scissors, Coin-Flip, Tic-Tac-Toe, Translator and much more.

If you find the repo interesting please mark a star. Also dont hesitate to fork the repo and build on these codes. Feedbacks, suggestions and issues highlights are welcome.
